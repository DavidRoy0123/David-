    <h2>Jesus on the Cross</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>John 3:16</strong> - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, 
      that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus was crucified to redeem humanity from sin. His sacrifice was the ultimate act of love. Through His death, we receive grace, mercy, and forgiveness. This act invites us to live a new life, filled with faith and hope.
    </p><h2>Why is the Bible Important?</h2>
<p>
  The Bible is God’s Word. It is the ultimate guidebook for life. It teaches love, patience, peace, strength in adversity, and the path to salvation. The Bible connects us to the Creator and shows us the way to eternal life.
</p>

<h2>Why Should You Read the Bible?</h2>

  <li>To understand God’s purpose for your life</li>
  <li>To find peace and hope during difficult times</li>
  <li>To gain wisdom and strength</li>
  <li>To discover the story of Jesus Christ and salvation</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Live a Perfect Life with the Bible</h2>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pray and trust in God’s plan</li>
  <li>Love others selflessly</li>
  <li>Forgive as Jesus forgave</li>
